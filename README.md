## Wut

[Counting with md5sum](http://www.reddit.com/live/thjep4nr9895) on Reddit has gotten near impossible to do without brute force of some kind.

This code in this repo runs on OS X bash command line.

## Do

    git clone https://github.com/thunderrabbit/live-md5-command-line-cheater.git live-cheat
    cd live-cheat
    ./md5nder.pl 'Okay, but your NOUN is so ADJECTIVE!' 124

## And

I also made a slow + fragile [live md5 count recursive cheater](http://thunderrabbit.github.io/live-md5-recursive-cheater/)
