## Wut

[Counting with md5sum](http://www.reddit.com/live/thjep4nr9895) on Reddit has gotten near impossible to do without brute force of some kind.

This code in this repo runs on OS X bash command line.

I also made a slow + fragile [live md5 count recursive cheater](http://thunderrabbit.github.io/live-md5-recursive-cheater/)

## Use

    git clone https://github.com/thunderrabbit/live-md5-command-line-cheater.git live-cheat
    cd live-cheat
    tr -d '\r' < live_count_md5.txt.adjectives | sed 's/^/Okay, but time machines are so /' | sed 's/$/!/' | ./md5nder.sh 124
